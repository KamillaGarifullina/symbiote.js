# Symbi<span style="color:#f0f">‡∞†</span>te.js

## ü•∑ Ultralight and ultrapowerful library to create widgets, organize micro-frontends, build reusable embeddable components and libraries. Everything you need for your modern web application!

### üî• Core benefits
* Minimalistic but reach
* No additional dependencies
* Ultralight (2.6kb br/gzip for featurefull CDN version)
* Blazing fast (faster than most of the other mainstream solutions. All of them.)
* Memory friendly (no any redux-like immutables)
* CSP friendly - good for enterprize usage
* Highly extensible
* Easy to learn - nothing completely new for experienced developers, nothing complicated for newbies
* Works in all modern browsers. As is.
* Easy to test
* TypeScript friendly - use it in TS or JS projects from the common source code
* Integration friendly: works with any modern development stack
* Lifecycle control: no need to initiate something from outside
* ESM friendly - native JavaScript modules are best!
* Developer Experience on the mind: compact & convenient APIs, habitual syntax
* Open source (MIT license)

### üíé Tech concept description
* Native `DocumentFragment` instead of expensive Virtual DOM sync
* Shadow DOM is optional. Use it when you need it only
* Styling approach: total freedom, from the old classics to the cutting age platforn abilities
* Native HTML and DOM API instead of expensive custom template syntax processing
* Templates are out of the component or render function context. It‚Äôs just a simple JavaScript template literals. So you can keep or process them wherever you want
* No logical operators in templates. Logic and presentation is strictly separated.
* Fast synchronous UI updates
* Full data context access from the document structure
* Full data context availability for template bindings
* DOM API friendly approach for the most perfomant solutions
* Convenient object model access instead of opaque abstractions
* Custom Elements work strange sometimes. Don‚Äôt worry about that, we do (construction flow)

### üçè Quick start
Easiest way to try Symbiote.js is to create simple `html` file in your text editor and connect the Symbiote base class from CDN:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { BaseComponent } from 'https://uc-jsdk.web.app/build/symbiote.js';

  class MyComponent extends BaseComponent {
    init$ = {
      count: 0,
      increment: () => {
        this.$.count++;
      },
    }
  }

  MyComponent.template = /*html*/ `
    <h2 set="textContent: count"></h2>
    <button set="onclick: increment">Click me!</button>
  `;

  MyComponent.reg('my-component');
</script>

<my-component></my-component>
```

**This code can work directly in any modern browser, so you don't need to install anything to try it!**

## ‚úÖ Browser support
Symbiote.js is supported and tested in all major modern desktop and mobile browsers: 
* Chrome
* Firefox
* Safari
* Edge
* Opera
* etc...

**Internet Explorer** - is outdated and not supported anymore:
